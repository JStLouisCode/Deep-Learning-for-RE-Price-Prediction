# Deep-Learning-for-RE-Price-Prediction
Deep learning model trained on a real estate price dataset, to estimate property values based on various features.

##Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately predict real estate prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and other relevant factors. The aim is to provide a tool that can assist in estimating property values and support decision-making in the real estate industry.

#Implementation
The project is implemented in a Python Jupyter notebook. The code performs the following major steps:
1. Importing necessary libraries and datasets: This section imports the required libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib. The real estate price dataset, 'realestate_prices.csv', is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
2. Data visualization: The dataset is visualized using scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to gain insights into the relationships between variables and identify patterns or trends.
3. Data cleaning and feature engineering: Data cleaning operations are performed to handle missing values or outliers. Feature engineering techniques may be applied to extract relevant features from the dataset and prepare it for modeling. The MinMaxScaler from the scikit-learn library is used to scale the feature values, ensuring that they are within a specific range for better model performance.
4. Training a deep learning model: A deep learning model is trained using a limited number of features from the dataset. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. The deep learning model, implemented using the Keras API, consists of several dense layers. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function. The model's training progress is visualized using line plots.
5. Evaluating model performance: Performance of the trained deep learning model is evaluated using various metrics. These metrics include root mean squared error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared (R2), and adjusted R-squared. The predictions made by the model are compared to the true values using scatter plots to assess the model's accuracy.

##Results and Discussion
The project's results show the performance of the trained deep learning model in predicting real estate prices. The evaluation metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the model. The discussion section may highlight any limitations or challenges encountered during the implementation and suggest potential areas for improvement.

##Usage 
To reproduce the project, follow these steps:
1. Set up a Python environment with the required libraries (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, tensorflow, scikit-learn).
2. Download the 'realestate_prices.csv' dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Execute the Jupyter notebook, running each code cell sequentially.
4. Modify or customize the code as needed to fit your specific requirements.

##Conclusion
The deep learning model developed in this project showcases the potential for predicting real estate prices based on various features. The accuracy of the model's predictions, as measured by evaluation metrics, demonstrates its effectiveness in estimating property values. However, further improvements can be made to enhance the model's performance and address any limitations identified during the project.
